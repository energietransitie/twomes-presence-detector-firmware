# About the device

This measurement device is meant for installation tests and testing the stability of the NeedForHeat data collection; after installation, the device will send a 'heartbeat' every 10 minutes to the NeedForHeat server using your home Wi-Fi network.

# Installation

## 1. Find a suitable spot

Find a free outlet in your living room that you won't need to use for something else for several weeks; the closer to your thermostat, the better.

## 2. Insert the plug into the outlet

Make sure the USB-cable is connected to the USB adapter and the device. This will only fit one way. Insert the plug into the outlet; you will see lights start to blink on the device. *Note that there is no dangerous voltage on the device...*
